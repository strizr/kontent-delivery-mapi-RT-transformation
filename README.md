# Delivery API RT -> Management API RT (Kontent by Kentico)

## How to run
```node transform```

## How does it work
The `transform` node.js script loads the contents of the `input` file and through a couple of regex transformations updates the **figures**(assets) and **links**, stripping the unsupported attributes generated by the Delivery API, while pushing the output to the `output` file. The result should be compatible with the Management API input.
